#GRADI BRID
##World's worst Flappy Bird clone, made in Scratch

A project made for a code jam at my computer science school.

As I wanted to "troll", and also because I was allowed to, I chose Scratch as my language of
choice to make this small project.

The files in this repo are a web version of the project so you can play with a beautiful
background made by yours truly.

#How to use

Download the repo, open index.html in your web browser, click the green flag and play !

#How to play

Press the space bar to jump, and go through the gaps formed by the pipes.

#Additional notes

The game has 2 easter eggs hidden in it. Can you find them ?
